<h1> Yes, I know Markdown. Kinda. </h1>
<h2> I also know how to write copy and communications. </h2>
<h3> I am learning how to make a static portfolio site here. </h3>
<h4> We will see how that goes. There's a lot to learn before it doesn't look awful. The last website I made was in 2004. It used a regular, free FTP server and I wrote each page in notepad in regular old HTML. I had grand plans for it that never panned out. </h4>
