<h1> Yes, I know Markdown. Kinda. </h1>
<h2> I also know how to write copy and communications. </h2>
<h3> I am learning how to make a static portfolio site here. </h3>
<h4> We will see how that goes. There's a lot to learn before it doesn't look awful. The last website I made was in 2004. It used a regular, free FTP server and I wrote each page in notepad in regular old HTML. I had grand plans for it that never panned out. </h4>
<h5> I have attempted to update this page and failed 3 times. So who knows? This page may also not pan out. But I think it's cool that I heard you could do this, and then tried to do it, and there was a helpful guide for it. </h5>
